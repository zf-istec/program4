    "\n",
    "## Preface\n",
    "\n",
    "This collection of Jupyter Notebooks serves as an overview of the materials to study in the Unit.\n",
    "The notebooks are used as the basis for lectures exposures and discussions, so you must study them carefully before coming to the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Jupyter notebook is a document that supports narrative text, Python executable code, equations and visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, get a copy of the notebooks from the GitHub public repository.\n",
    "Then, to prepare for the lecture you read the notebook, change and execute the Python code; during the class you may use your copy of the notebook to take notes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you find mistakes or have suggestions for improvements in the notebooks, please let me know (zafeiris AT my.istec.pt).**\n",
    "\n",
    "About 2/3 of the materials are based on the open-source book: \n",
    "[How to Think Like a Computer Scientist](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Tips\n",
    "\n",
    "- The notebooks are used as well in the class, to illustrate the discussions and the coding examples; therefore, there are no slides to study the class matters later; moreover, it should be noted that the notebooks are NOT a replacement for **studying the bibliography** listed in the work plan\n",
    "\n",
    "- \"Students are responsible for anything that transpires during a class—therefore **if you're not in a class**, you should get notes from someone else (not the instructor)\" — David Mayer\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Code\n",
    "\n",
    "- Have a look at the code in the GitHub public repository at https://github.com/zf-istec/program4/\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Software\n",
    "\n",
    "To run the examples and annotate your copy of these notebooks, you must have in your machine:\n",
    "Python3, Spyder3 and jupyter-notebooks.\n",
    "For that you may install Anaconda or else Miniconda.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1 Anaconda3-2022.10-Linux\n",

    "in Linux (e.g. Ubuntu), MAC OS, Windows.\n",
