##### Print all students with a count of their courses.

#    print(name, "takes", len(subjects), "courses")

##### Count how many students are taking CompSci
    
# Now we’d like to ask how many students are taking CompSci. 
# This needs a counter, and for each student we need a
# second loop that tests each of the subjects in turn:
  
#counter = 0                      # how many, needs a counter
#for name, subjects in students:  # for each student
#    for s in subjects:           # for each subject (A nested loop!)
#        if s == "CompSci":
#            counter += 1
#            break
#print("\nThe number of students taking \"CompSci\" is", counter)
