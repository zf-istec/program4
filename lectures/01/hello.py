#### AUTOCOMPLETE #######
#
# Spyder can autocomplete names for you.
# Start typing a variable name defined in your program and hit tab 
# before you finish typing;
# try it below

# define a variable
a_very_long_variable_name_dont_name_them_this_long_pls = 0

# below, start typing a_ve then hit tab... cool, right!
# use autocomplete to change the value of that variable to 1

# use autocomplete to write a line that prints the value;
# Spyder also automatically adds the closed parentheses
